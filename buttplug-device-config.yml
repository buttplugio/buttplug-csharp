# Welcome to Buttplug Device Config
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.
#
# Use user-device-config.yml for local device definitions.
#
# Now that we've got that bit of impoliteness out of the way... Hi,
# I'm qDot. Welcome to the buttplug device configuration file.
#
# You've managed to wander into this place we keep all of the sex toy
# information. You're not really supposed to be here, but since you've
# shown up, might as give you a tour.
#
# Devices in Buttplug have the following info:
#
# - Protocol (Required)
#
#   - The language we talk to the device. In our config file, these
#     will all have specific names, usually brands like Lovense or
#     WeVibe. In some cases, specific toys may have their own protocol
#     too, like the Fleshlight Launch. Devices should usually only
#     have one protocol.
#
# - Identifier (name: id, Optional)
#
#   - The information we use to find a device. This will vary
#     depending on our bus type. Bluetooth needs name, service IDs,
#     etc. USB needs vendor ID and product ID pairs. This field is
#     optional, as we can't look for devices on serial ports or wifi
#     easily, and we expect the user to help us with those by
#     providing more information in their local config file.
#
# - Configuration (name: config, Optional)
#
#   - Common settings for a device. Usually used for serial.

# Define identifier types. These are the only values devices can have
# in their connection-info lists.

connection-info-types:
  - btclassic
  - btle
  - serial
  - usb
  - hid

# This is the list of possible protocols. Buttplug servers implement
# these protocols. Servers scan for devices (based on the information
# given below) and match the device with the protocol to present
# control to the user.

# protocols:
#   - lovense
#   - xinput
#   - erostek-et312
#   - erostek-et232
#   - wevibe
#   - vorze-sa
#   - vorze-cyclone
#   - kiiroo-v1
#   - kiiroo-v2
#   - libo
#   - magic-motion
#   - mysteryvibe
#   - picobong
#   - vibratissimo
#   - youcups
#   - trancevibrator

# Now for the actual protocol definitions. This is gonna get wild, so
# I'll keep a list of rules that you can refer to up here.
#
# - If you are curious about device identifiers or protocols, all
#   of those are documented at https://stpihkal.docs.buttplug.io
#
# - Some fields can be wildcarded using "*". This allows us to do
#   things like searching for all devices of a certain name.
#
# - Where possible, we assume all devices have at least one output (so
#   we can send the commands), and maybe one input. In cases
#   otherwise, a comment should be left denoting what we're doing
#   something different.
#
# - Most toys just mirror good ol' serial. With that in mind, we call
#   the host-to-device line tx, and device-to-host line rx.
#
# - If you see a "btle" connection info with service IDs but no
#   characteristic IDs, this means that we'll try autodetecting the
#   characteristics. We'll just expect it to have an input (which
#   we'll name "rx") and an output characteristic (which we'll name
#   "tx"), as mentioned above.
#
# - Similarly for USB, we'll test endpoints for r/w flags when no
#   endpoint handles are passed.
#
# - A "btle" connection info with multiple service listings can mean
#   one of two things. Either we expect the device to be identifiable
#   as multiple services (like Lovense), or the device may have
#   multiple services we use (like some BTLE toys that divide control
#   and sensor between different services).
#
# - If you're connecting to a buttplug server and don't see a device
#   that's listed here, it's not the fault of this config file.
#   Servers may not implement all protocols or busses for various
#   reasons. We just define which devices we may know about here. File
#   an issue on the library you're using.
#
# - If you're connecting to a buttplug server and some device doesn't
#   take a Buttplug message you're expecting it to, it's not the fault
#   of this config file. Servers implement protocols, and protocols
#   dictate which messages they are capable of sending. We don't
#   really keep a standard for that, we just define which devices we
#   may know about here. File an issue on the library you're using.
#
# - Serial info here is for default device configuration.

      # Lovense have changed BLE name formats at least once. For this
      # generic device, we just use the largest wildcard we can. We do
      # our name and capabilities finding in the protocol
      # implementation, because we have to query the device after
      # connection.
      #
      # The service uuids change constantly. This list is overly
      # exhaustive, because we have to specify services in WebBluetooth
      # and can't wildcard them. We'll add more as we find them.
