Buttplug is a framework for hooking up hardware to interfaces, where
hardware usually means sex toys, but could honestly be just about
anything. It's basically a userland HID manager for things that may
not specifically be HID.

Vibration Router, or Kiiroo Emulator, [visit our releases page.](https://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-csharp/releases/)

[follow this link to the nuget "buttplug" search](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=buttplug).

### Special Installation Steps When Building Buttplug Applications

Due to a bug in the Windows 15063 SDK, applications using the BLE APIs
need to have an AppId in the registry with a special SDDL access
string. For more info on this bug,
see
[this msdn forums post](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/58da3fdb-a0e1-4161-8af3-778b6839f4e1/bluetooth-bluetoothledevicefromidasync-does-not-complete-on-10015063?forum=wdk#ef927009-676c-47bb-8201-8a80d2323a7f).

For those using the installer, this step should be taken care of by
InnoSetup. If you are building the project locally, start regedit,
then choose File > Import, and select the app.reg file in this repo.
This will set permissions for all executables named Buttplug.exe,
ButtplugCLI.exe, and ButtplugGUI.exe

## Third Party Applications Using Buttplug C#

- [ScriptPlayer](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer) - Native hardware synced movie player for Windows.
- [Caveman BIOS Teaches Typing](https://curiousjp.itch.io/caveman-bios-teaches-erotic-typing) - Typing Training Game
