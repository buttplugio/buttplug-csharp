Buttplug is a framework for hooking up hardware to interfaces, where
hardware usually means sex toys, but could honestly be just about
anything. Think of it as a userland HID manager for things that may
not specifically be HID, but may go in your butt.

Vibration Router software, [visit our releases page.](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp/releases/)

## Installation

### Libraries for Development

Packages and libraries from the buttplug-csharp repo are available via
[nuget](http://nuget.org). Simply run a search for "buttplug", or
[follow this link to the nuget "buttplug" search](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=buttplug).

### Client Software (Server, Game Vibration Router)

The Buttplug C# Repo hosts the Buttplug C# Development Libraries, as
well as the following applications, known as the Buttplug Application Suite:

- Buttplug Server
- Game Vibration Router

To download the installer for these applications, [visit our releases page.](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp/releases/)

### Special Installation Steps When Developing Buttplug Applications

Due to a bug in the Windows 15063 SDK, applications using the BLE APIs
need to have an AppId in the registry with a special SDDL access
string. For more info on this bug,
see
[this msdn forums post](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/58da3fdb-a0e1-4161-8af3-778b6839f4e1/bluetooth-bluetoothledevicefromidasync-does-not-complete-on-10015063?forum=wdk#ef927009-676c-47bb-8201-8a80d2323a7f).

This bug has been fixed as of Windows 10 Build 16053, so this note is
only relevant if you have users still running on Windows 10 Build
15063 or earlier. To get the build number of a Windows installation,
run the "winver" command.

To fix this issue, we add a registry key in the installer for the
Buttplug Application Suite. Check out the buttplug-installer.ino file
to see how it works.

## Third Party Applications Using Buttplug C#
