            // We'll need a connector first, as creating a client requires a connector. Connectors
            // are how clients connect to servers. Since we're just starting out and don't want to
            // deal with networks or IPC yet, we'll create an embedded client. This means that the
            // Connector holds a Buttplug Server itself, so everything happens locally. This is
            // usually the easiest case to develop with.
            //
            // For now, we'll just give the server a name. We'll go over other versions of the
            // constructor in later examples.

            // be how we communicate with Buttplug, and to the hardware that Buttplug deals with.
            //
            // We can give the client a name, which is sent to the server so we can identify what's
            // connected on that end if the server has a GUI. We also hand it the connector we just
            // made, so it knows how/what to connect to when we call Connect() on it.
            //
            // We don't really need to keep ownership of the connector outside of the client, so you
            // could just pass a newly created object here instead of storing it to a variable, but

            // that can take a while, this call is awaited. However, since our connector is embedded
            // and contains the server, this should pretty much return immediately, so we'll skip
            // sending it a Token.

            // around and disconnect. Once again, this is local, and since we haven't made any device
            // connections yet it's basically a simple function call, so it should return immediately.
